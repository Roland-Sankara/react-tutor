### Props Vs State

Props
- These are input to s react component
- They are similar to function parameters
- Immutable (Can't be changed)
- They cause the page to re-render

State
- It's data managed by a component
- Similar to a local variable
- It's mutable
- It's causes a re-render of the page

const [eggs, setEggs] = useState(0)
